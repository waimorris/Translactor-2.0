 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

献给马克斯·柏金斯

他是一个老人，独自一人划着小船在墨西哥湾的洋流中捕鱼，现在已经八十四天没有捕到鱼了。在前四十天里，有个男孩和他在一起。但是在连续四十天没捕到鱼之后，男孩的父母告诉他，这位老人现在肯定是完全倒霉的，这是最糟糕的倒楣形式，而男孩便按照他们的命令，去了另一艘船上，第一周就捕到了三条好鱼。看到老人每天拖着空船回来，男孩觉得很难过，他总是下去帮他搬运起着皱曲绳索或鱼叉和鱼叉以及捲绕在桅杆周围的帆。帆上补丁一片，被捲起来时看起来就像永久失败的旗帜。
老人瘦削而消瘦，脖子后面有深深的皱纹。从太阳的 反射来的对热带海洋的仁慈的皮肤癌带来的棕色斑块在他的脸颊上。斑块很好地延伸到他脸的两侧，他的手上有处理重鱼时留下的深深的瘢痕。但是这些瘢痕中没有一个是新的。它们和一个无鱼的沙漠中的侵蚀一样古老。
他身上的一切都是旧的，除了他的眼睛，它们和海的颜色一样，是明亮而不屈的。
“桑地亚哥，”男孩对他说，当他们从把小船拉上的土坡上爬下来时。“我可以再和你一起去。我们挣了些钱。”
老人教会了男孩捕鱼，男孩爱他。

“但是你记得吗，你曾经整整八十七天没有捕到鱼，然后我们接连三个星期每天都捕到大鱼。”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“是爸爸让我离开的。我是个男孩，我必须听他的话。”
“我知道。”老人说。“这很正常。”
“他并不十分信任我。”
“是的。”老人说。“但我们信任彼此，对吧？”
“是的。”男孩说。“我能请你在露台上喝一杯啤酒然后我们带东西回家吗？”
“为什么不呢？”老人说。“渔夫之间的交情。”
他们坐在露台上，许多渔夫取笑老人，但他并没有生气。其他一些年长的渔夫看着他，心里感到伤心，但他们没有表现出来，礼貌地谈论着他们下钓的地点、当前的天气、稳定的好天气以及他们所看到的一切。那一天捕鱼成功的渔夫已经回来，把他们的马林鱼屠宰完整，横放在两块木板上，每个木板末端站着两个人，然后他们把鱼拉到等待着冰车将它们送到哈瓦那市场的鱼仓去。
那些捕到鲨鱼的人已经把它们带到了海湾另一边的鲨鱼加工厂，在那里，它们被吊在一个绞盘上，取出肝脏、切掉鳍、剥下皮，把肉切成条来腌制。
当风从东边吹过的时候，从鲨鱼加工厂传来了一股气味；但今天只有轻微的异味，因为风向转变到了北方，然后风渐渐减弱，露台上阳光明媚，令人感到愉快。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩说。
“是的。”老人说。他端着酒杯，回忆着许多年前的事。
“我明天可以帮你去捞些沙丁鱼吗？”
“不用了。去打棒球吧。我还能划船，罗海里奥会扔渔网。”
“我想去。如果不能和你一起钓鱼，我想以其他方式为你服务。”
“你给我买了一杯啤酒，”老人说。“你已经是个男子汉了。”
“当你第一次让我上船的时候，我有多大？”
“五岁，当时你差点被我抓到的鱼给弄死，它几乎把船撕成碎片。你记得吗？”
“我记得尾巴拍打的声音，船板破碎的声音，拍打的声音。我记得你把我扔到船头，那里湿漉漉的线绕在一起，整艘船都在颤抖，你砍击的声音就像砍树一样，还有我满身弥漫着甜美的血腥味。”
“你真的还记得那些还是我告诉过你？”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”

“我记得我们第一次一起出海时的一切。”
老人用晒黑了的自信和爱的眼睛看着他。
“如果你是我儿子，我会带你出去赌一把，”他说，“但你是你父亲和母亲的孩子，而且你在一艘幸运的船上。”
“我可以去找沙丁鱼吗？我知道哪里还可以搞到四个鱼饵。”
“我今天剩下的还有。我把它们放在盒子里用盐腌着。”
“让我去弄四个新鲜的吧。”
“一个，”老人说。他的希望和信心从未消失过。但现在他们像微风般一样重新振作起来。
“两个，”男孩说。
“两个，”老人同意了。“你没有偷吗？”
“我本来会偷的，”男孩说，“但这些是我买的。”
“谢谢你，”老人说。他过于朴素以至于不知道自己是何时获得了谦卑。但他知道自己已经获得了，并且知道这并不可耻，也并没有失去真正的自豪。
“明天会是个好日子，有这样的洋流，”他说。
“你打算去哪里？”男孩问。
“远离，在风向转变之前返航。我想在天还没亮之前出发。”
“我会试着让他远航，”男孩说，“那样如果你钓上了一条真正大的鱼，我们可以前去帮忙。”
“他不喜欢远航。”
“是的，”男孩说，“但我会看到他看不到的东西，比如一只在觅食的鸟，然后引诱他追随海豚。”
“他的眼睛那么差了吗？”
“他几乎瞎了。”
“真奇怪，”老人说，“他从来没去过捕龟。那才是伤害眼睛的。”
“但你在蚊子海岸捕龟了很多年，你的眼睛却很好。”
“我是一个奇怪的老人。”
“但你现在是否足够强壮去钓到一条真正大的鱼？”
“我想我可以。而且我还有很多窍门。”
“让我们把东西带回家吧，”男孩说。“这样我就能拿着投网去抓沙丁鱼了。”
他们从船上拿起装备。老人用肩膀扛着桅杆。

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

老人和男孩拿着木船，上面缠着牢固的棕色绳索，还有拐杖和带杆的鱼叉。装着鱼饵的盒子放在小船的艉部，旁边是用来制服大鱼的木棍。虽然没有人会从老人那里偷东西，但把帆和厚重的绳索带回家更安全，因为露水对它们有害，而且尽管老人相当肯定当地人不会从他那里偷东西，但老人认为在小船上留下拐杖和鱼叉是没必要的诱惑。
他们一起沿着路走到老人的小屋，然后通过敞开的门进去。老人把裹着帆的桅杆靠在墙上，男孩把盒子和其他装备放在旁边。桅杆几乎跟小屋的一间房一样长。小屋是用皇家棕榈坚韧的芽鳞建造的，当地称之为瓜诺，在里面有一张床，一张桌子，一把椅子，以及一个用木炭烹饪的地方。在坚固纤维的瓜诺叶子重叠的褐色墙壁上，有彩色圣耶稣圣心像和圣科布雷像。这是他妻子的遗物。过去墙上还挂着他妻子的一张着色照片，但他把它取下来了，因为看到它会让他感到太孤独，而且它现在放在墙角的擦干净的衬衫下面。
“你吃什么？”男孩问道。
“一锅黄米饭配鱼。你要吃吗？”
“不，我回家吃。你要我生火吗？”
“不，我一会儿自己生。或者我可能吃冷饭。”
“我拿着投网去了？”
“当然可以。”
其实并没有投网，男孩记得他们卖掉了。但他们每天都会玩这个游戏。也并没有一锅黄米饭和鱼，男孩也知道这点。“八十五是个幸运数字，”老人说。“你想看我拿到一个重过千磅的鱼吗？”“我去拿投网，去捉沙丁鱼。你会坐在门口晒太阳吗？”
“好的，我有昨天的报纸，可以看棒球。”男孩不确定昨天的报纸是否也是虚构的。但老人从床底下拿出来。
“佩里科在杂货店给了我，”他解释道。“等我捉到沙丁鱼回来。我会把你的和我的都放在冰上，明天早上我们可以一起分享。回来后你可以和我讲棒球比赛。”
“洋基队不会输。”
“但我担心克利夫兰印第安人队。”

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway

To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

他是一个在墨西哥湾独自划着小船捕鱼的老人，已经八十四天没有捕到鱼了。在开头的四十天里，有一个男孩和他在一起。但是在四十天内没有捕到鱼后，男孩的父母告诉他，老人现在肯定是完全倒霉了，这是最糟糕的倒霉形式，男孩遵照他们的命令去了另一条船上，第一周就捕到了三条好鱼。看到老人每天划着空船回来使男孩很伤心，他总是下去帮忙搬运捆绑的线或者鱼叉和帆，帆绕着桅杆卷起。帆是用面粉袋补的，卷起来看起来像永久失败的旗帜。
老人瘦骨嶙峋，脖子后面有深深的皱纹。阳光在热带海洋的反射上会造成和善的皮肤癌，褐色斑块在他的脸颊上。斑块从他的脸两侧一直延伸下去，他的手上有处理重鱼时留下的深深皱纹疤痕。但是这些疤痕没有一处是新的，它们像无鱼之地的侵蚀一样古老。
他身上的一切都是老的，除了他的眼睛，它们和海洋一样的颜色，明亮而不屈。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩对他说，在他们从拖上岸的船边爬上去的时候，“我可以再和你一起去。我们挣了些钱。”
老人教会了男孩如何捕鱼，男孩爱他。
“不，”老人说，“你跟着一个幸运的船队。留在他们身边。”
“但是你记得你曾经八十七天没捕到鱼，然后我们连续三个星期每天都捕到大的。”

“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“是父亲让我离开的。我是个孩子，必须服从他。”
“我知道，”老人说道。“这是很正常的。”
“他并不太信任我。”
“不，”老人说。“但是我们信任。对吗？”
“是的，”男孩说。“我请你在露台上喝杯啤酒，然后我们把东西带回家吧。”
“为什么不呢？”老人说。“渔夫之间。”
他们坐在露台上，许多渔夫取笑老人，他并没有生气。其他年长的渔夫看着他，感到悲伤。但他们没有表现出来，礼貌地谈论着他们在哪里遇到鱼群、他们漂浮线的深度、持续良好的天气以及他们所看到的。那天成功的渔夫已经回来，屠宰了他们的旗鱼，并把它们横放在两条木板上，两个人在每条木板的末端挣扎着支撑着，然后将它们带到鱼行等待冰车把它们运送到哈瓦那市场。捕到鲨鱼的人则把它们带到海湾另一边的鲨鱼工厂，那里的鲨鱼被吊起来，肝脏被取出，鳍被切割，皮被剥除，肉被切成条用来腌制。
当风从东方吹来时，从鲨鱼工厂传来一股异味；但是今天只有微弱的气味，因为风转向北方，然后减弱了，在露台上阳光明媚、宜人。
“桑地亚哥，”男孩说道。
“是的，”老人说道。他拿着杯子，思念着多年前的往事。
“明天我可以帮你去收些沙丁鱼吗？”
“不要了。去打棒球吧。我依然可以划船，罗海利奥会投网。”
“我想去。如果不能和你一起钓鱼，我想以其他方式为你服务。”
“你请我喝啤酒，”老人说道。“你已经长大了。”
“当初你带我上船时我多大？”
“五岁，当时你差点被杀，当我把鱼拉上来时太生疏了，它差点把船撕碎。你还记得吗？”
“我记得尾巴拍打和撞击，座板破裂和击击声。我记得你把我扔到船头，湿漉漉的绳子团在那里，感觉整条船在颤抖，听到你像砍伐树木一样砸打着它，还有满身都是的甜美血腥味。”
“你真的记得那些还是我告诉过你？”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

“我记得我们第一次一起出海的时候的一切。”
老人用晒黑了的、自信和充满爱意的眼睛看着他。
“如果你是我的儿子，我会带你出去赌博的，”他说，“但你是你父亲和母亲的孩子，你运气好，坐的是幸运的船。”
“我去买沙丁鱼吗？我知道哪里还能弄到四个鱼饵。”
“我今天剩下的还有。我把它们放在盒子里用盐腌起来了。”
“让我再去买四个新鲜的。”
“一个，”老人说。他的希望和自信从未消失。但现在它们像微风拂过时一样又焕发了新生。
“两个，”男孩说。
“两个，”老人同意了。“你没有偷来的吧？”
“我会偷的，”男孩说，“但这些是我买的。”
“谢谢你，”老人说。他太单纯了，不会想知道他是何时变得如此谦逊。但他知道自己已经变得谦逊，他知道这并非可耻，也不会损害真正的骄傲。
“明天风向转变时将会是一个好日子，”他说。
“你要去哪里？”男孩问。
“远离后再返回。我想在天还没亮之前就出海。”
“我会努力让他在海上工作更远一点，”男孩说，“那样如果你钓上了一条真正大的鱼，我们就能帮忙。”
“他不喜欢在海上工作太远的地方。”
“不，”男孩说。“但我会看到一些他看不到的事物，比如一只捕鱼的鸟，然后引他出去追逐海豚。”
“他的眼睛那么糟糕吗？”
“他几乎瞎了。”
“真奇怪，”老人说，“他从未捕过海龟。那才是导致眼睛受伤的原因。”
“而你曾经在蚊子海岸捕过海龟多年，你的眼睛还是很好。”
“我是一个奇怪的老人。”
“你现在有足够的力气去钓一条真正大的鱼吗？”
“我认为可以。而且有许多诀窍。”
“我们把东西带回家吧，”男孩说，“这样我可以拿起抛网去捕沙丁鱼。”
他们从船上拿起装备。老人用他的肩膀扛着桅杆。 - 3 -

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

男孩提着木船，船上缠着坚硬的棕色绳子，还有鱼叉和附带杆的鱼叉。存放鱼饵的盒子放在小船的船尾下面，还有一根用来制服大鱼的棍子，当它们被拖到船边时会用到。没有人会从老人那里偷东西，但最好把帆和粗绳带回家，因为露水对它们不利，尽管老人很确定当地人不会从他那里偷东西，但老人认为，把一把鱼叉和鱼叉留在船上是种冒险。
他们一起沿着路走到老人的棚屋，穿过开着的门进去。老人把缠着帆的桅杆靠在墙上，男孩把盒子和其他配件放在旁边。桅杆几乎和棚屋的房间一样长。棚屋是用被称为瓜乃的皇家棕榈坚韧的叶壳做的，在里面有一张床、一张桌子、一把椅子，和一个用木炭烹饪的地方。坚固有纤维的瓜乃叶的棕色墙上挂着一幅彩色耶稣圣心像和一幅科布雷圣母像。这些是他妻子的遗物。墙上曾经有一张着色照片的妻子，但他把它取了下来，因为看到它会让他感到太孤独，现在它放在了角落的搁板上，下面是他干净的衬衣。
“你想吃什么？”男孩问道。
“一锅黄米鱼。你要吃吗？”
“不，我会在家吃。你要我生火吗？”
“不，我过会再生。或者我可能冷食米饭。”
“我可以拿招鱼网吗？”
“当然可以。”
并没有招鱼网，男孩记得他们卖掉了它。但他们每天都过着这种虚拟的生活。并没有一锅黄米鱼，男孩也知道这一点。“85是个幸运数字，”老人说。“你想看我抓一只有一千多磅的鱼出来吗？”“我会拿来招鱼网，去捕沙丁鱼，你愿意坐在门口晒太阳吗？”
“好的。我昨天的报纸，我会看棒球。”男孩不知道昨天的报纸也是虚构的吗。但老人从床底下拿出来了。
“佩里科在小店给了我，”他解释说。“拿着我去捕沙丁鱼。我会把你的和我的放在冰上，明天我们早上分享。等我回来你告诉我棒球的事。”
“洋基队不会输。”
“但我担心克利夫兰的印第安人。”

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

他是一个老人，独自一人在墨西哥湾的一只小帆船上垂钓，已经八十四天没有捞到鱼了。在最初的四十天里，有一个男孩和他在一起。但在经过四十天没有捞到鱼后，男孩的父母告诉他，老人现在肯定是完蛋了，这是最糟糕的倒霉形式，于是男孩听从他们的命令，去了另一只船，在第一周捕获了三条好鱼。看到老人每天带着空空的小船回来，男孩感到难过，他总是下去帮忙搬运盘绕的渔线、鱼叉和围绕桅杆裹起来的帆。那帆用面粉袋修补过，卷起来看起来像是永久失败的旗帜。
老人瘦削，颈部有深深的皱纹。慈善性皮肤癌在他的面颊上形成了褐色的斑块，是阳光在热带海洋上的反射带来的。这些斑块延伸到他脸的两侧，他的手上有因为处理重鱼而留下的深深的伤痕。但是这些伤疤都不是新的，就像是在一个无鱼的沙漠里老化的侵蚀一样。
除了他的眼睛，一切都显得陈旧，而他的眼睛和海洋的颜色一样，是愉快而坚强的。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩对他说，当他们从缆绳拉的地方爬上岸时。“我可以再跟你去垂钓。我们赚了一些钱。”
老人教会了男孩如何捕鱼，男孩很爱他。
“不，”老人说。“你与一只幸运的船在一起。留在他们那里。”
“但是记得你曾经连续八十七天没有捞到鱼，然后我们接连三个星期每天都捕到大鱼。”

them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“是爸爸让我离开的。我是个孩子，我必须服从他。”
“我知道，”老人说。“这很正常。”
“他并不太有信心。”
“不错，”老人说。“但我们有。对吧？”
“是的，”男孩说。“我请你到露台上喝啤酒，然后我们就把东西带回家吧。”
“为什么不呢？”老人说。“渔夫之间。”
他们坐在露台上，许多渔夫取笑老人，但他并没有生气。其他一些年长的渔夫看着他，感到悲伤。但他们没有表现出来，礼貌地谈论着他们的垂钓地点，当前深度和稳定的好天气，以及他们所看到的一切。那天取得成功的渔夫已经回来了，他们已经屠宰了自己的旗鱼，并用两块木板横着背负着它们，每块木板的一端都由两人扛着，把它们带到鱼屋里，等待冰车将它们运到哈瓦那市场。那些捕到鲨鱼的人则把它们带到了海湾对面的鲨鱼加工厂，那里用绞盘升起它们，取出它们的肝脏、切掉它们的鳍、剥皮并将肉切成条以便盐腌。
东风吹来时，从鲨鱼加工厂传来一股恶臭；但今天只有一丝轻微的气味，因为风向已经转向北方，并且减弱了，露台上阳光明媚宜人。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩说道。
“嗯，”老人说。他拿着杯子，心里想着许多年前的事情。
“我去捕些明天的沙丁鱼给你吧？”
“不用了。去打棒球吧。我还能划船，罗海利奥会撒网。”
“我想去。如果不能和你一起钓鱼，我想以某种方式为你服务。”
“你给我买啤酒了，”老人说。“你已经是个男人了。”
“我第一次跟你去船上时多大？”
“五岁，当时你差点被我把鱼拉上来时太青，结果几乎把船摧毁了。你还记得吗？”
“我记得尾部拍打声、碰撞声，船板断裂声以及用棍子敲击的声音。我记得你把我扔到湿漉漉的船头，感觉整条船都在颤抖，我能闻到你砍伤它的甜美鲜血气味。”
“你真的记得那件事吗，还是我只是告诉过你？”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

“我记得我们第一次一起出海的一切。”
老人用那种被太阳灼伤、满含信心和爱意的眼神看着他。
“如果你是我的孩子，我会带你出去赌博，”他说。“但你是你父亲和母亲的孩子，而你现在坐在一艘幸运的船上。”
“我去拿沙丁鱼可以吗？我还知道哪里能找到四个鱼饵。”
“我今天的还剩下一些。我把它们放在盒子里加了盐。”
“让我去拿四个新鲜的。”
“一个，”老人说。他的希望和信心从未消失。但现在它们像微风一样清新起来。
“两个，”男孩说。
“两个，”老人同意了。“你没有偷吧？”
“我本来会偷的，”男孩说，“但这些是我买的。”
“谢谢你，”老人说。他太简单了，不会想到自己何时获得了谦卑。但他知道自己已经获得了，并且他知道这并不是可耻的，也不会失去真正的骄傲。
“明天有了这股洋流，会是一个好日子，”他说。
“你去哪里？”男孩问。
“远远地出海，等风向转变再回来。我想在天亮之前就出发。”
“我会努力让他外出工作，”男孩说。“如果你钓到了一条真正大的鱼，我们就会前来帮忙。”
“他不喜欢太远出海工作。”
“是的，”男孩说。“但我会看到一些他看不到的东西，比如一只在猎食的鸟，然后让他出海捕鲜鱼。”
“他的眼睛那么糟糕吗？”
“他几乎瞎了。”
“这很奇怪，”老人说。“他从来没去捕龟。那才是毁灭眼睛的。”
“但你在蚊子海岸捕龟多年，你的眼睛还好。”
“我是一个奇怪的老人。”
“但现在你是否足够强大去钓一条真正大的鱼？”
“我想是的。而且还有很多技巧。”
“我们把东西拿回家，”男孩说。“这样我可以拿上投网去捕沙丁鱼。”
他们从船上拿起装备。老人把桅杆搭在肩上。

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

老人和男孩一起携带着木船，上面缠着一根硬编制的棕色绳索，还有一只鱼钩和带有柄的鱼叉。船尾下面放着饵料盒，以及用来制服大鱼的棍子，当它们被拉到船边时会被使用。没有人会从老人那里偷东西，但最好把帆和厚重的绳索带回家，因为露水对它们有害，尽管老人很确定当地人不会从他那里偷，但老人认为在船上留下一只鱼钩和一只鱼叉是不必要的诱惑。
他们一起沿着路走到老人的小棚屋，走进打开的门。老人将带着包裹帆的桅杆靠在墙上，男孩把箱子和其他装备放在旁边。桅杆差不多和棚屋的一个房间那么长。棚屋是用称为guano的皇家棕榈坚硬的芽壳搭建的，在里面有一张床，一张桌子，一把椅子，以及一个用木炭烹饪的灶台。在坚固纤维的guano叶片的棕色墙壁上，有一幅彩色的耶稣圣心像和另一幅圣库伯尔圣母像。这些是他妻子的遗物。墙上曾经挂着他妻子的一张着色照片，但他把它拿下来了，因为看到它让他感到太孤单，现在它放在角落的架子上，被他干净的衬衫盖住了。
“你想吃什么？”男孩问。
“一锅黄米鱼饭。你想吃吗？”
“不，我会在家吃。你想让我生火吗？”
“不，我稍后再生火。或者我可能吃冷饭。”
“我能拿着投网吗？”
“当然。”
投网已经没有了，男孩记得他们什么时候将它卖掉了。但他们每天都演出这个虚构的剧情。没有黄米鱼饭，男孩也知道这一点。“85是个吉祥数字，”老人说。“你想看到我带回一条超过一千磅的鱼是什么样子吗？”“我会拿着投网去捞沙丁鱼。你会坐在门口晒太阳吗？”
“会的。我有昨天的报纸，我会看棒球。”男孩不知道昨天的报纸是否也是虚构的。但老人从床底下拿了出来。
“佩里科在酒铺给我的，”他解释道。“我拿沙丁鱼回来的时候会带冰把你的和我的都放在一起，然后我们早上可以一起分享。回来的时候你可以告诉我棒球的情况。”
“洋基队不会输。”
“但我害怕克利夫兰的印第安人队。”

The Old Man and the Sea

To Charlie Shribner

To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

他是一个在墨西哥湾串流中独自钓鱼的老人，现在已经八十四天没有捕到鱼了。在头四十天里，有个男孩和他在一起。但是在四十天没有捕到鱼后，男孩的父母告诉他，这位老人现在确实是最不幸的salao了，并且男孩按照他们的命令去了另一只船上，那只船在第一周就捉到了三条好鱼。看到老人每天都空着船回来，男孩觉得伤心，并且总是下去帮忙搬运缠绕的渔线，鱼叉和捕鲸叉，还有卷在桅杆周围的帆。那帆用面粉袋补丁修补着，收起来时看起来就像永久失败的旗帜。
老人身材瘦弱，脖子后面有深深的皱纹。太阳引发的良性皮肤癌的褐色斑块在他的脸颊上。斑块延伸至他的脸颊两侧，他的手上有处理重鱼钓绳而留下的深深皱纹的疤痕。但是这些伤疤一个也不是新的，都像是在一个鱼类荒漠中侵蚀的沟壑一样古老。
他身上一切都是古老的，除了他的眼睛，它们和大海同色，明亮而不败。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩跟他说，当他们从拖上岸的船旁爬上岸时。“我可以再和你一起去。我们赚了一些钱。”
老人曾经教过男孩钓鱼，男孩爱他。
“不，”老人说。“你在一个幸运的船上。留在他们那里。”
“但是记得你曾经八十七天没捕到鱼，然后我们连续三周每天都捉到大鱼。”- 1 -

“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

他是一个独自在墨西哥湾游弋的老渔夫，已经八十四天没有捕到鱼了。在最初的四十天，有个男孩和他在一起。但是四十天过去了，鱼还是没有上钩，男孩的父母告诉他，这位老人现在肯定是完全倒霉的“萨拉奥”（译注：西班牙语，含倒霉、不吉祥的意思），男孩遵照他们的指示，上了另一艘船，第一周就捕到了三条大鱼。看到老人每天推着空船回来，男孩感到很难过，他总是下去帮忙，不论是把卷绕的渔线，还是鱼叉和鱼叉杆，或是绕在桅杆周围的帆，老人都要搬下来。那块帆上补着面粉袋，卷起来的样子看起来就像永久失败的旗帜。
老人瘦弱，脖子后面布满深深的皱纹。他的双颊上布满了日光照射在热带海洋上时的良性皮肤癌斑。这些斑点延伸至他脸的两侧，他的手上有摸着沉重鱼线留下的深深的疤痕。但这些疤痕都不是新的，它们像是一片没有鱼的沙漠一样古老。
他的一切都很古老，除了他的眼睛，它们和海洋一样的颜色，明亮而不亚于海洋。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩跟他说，他们从拉上岸的船上爬上坡。“我可以再和你一起去。我们赚了点钱。”
老人教会了男孩如何打渔，男孩很爱他。
“不，”老人说。“你现在是跟着一艘幸运的船。留在那里吧。”
“但是你还记得你曾经八十七天没有捕到鱼，然后我们连续三个星期每天都抓到大鱼的事吗？”

“是爸爸让我离开的。我是个孩子，我必须听从他。”
“我知道，”老人说。“这很正常。”
“他并不太信任我。”
“不，”老人说。“但我们信任你，对吗？”
“是的，”男孩说。“我在露台上请你喝一杯啤酒，然后我们就把东西带回家。”
“为什么不呢？”老人说。“渔民之间嘛。”
他们坐在露台上，许多渔民嘲笑老人，但他并没有生气。其他年长的渔民看着他，感到悲伤。但他们没有表现出来，礼貌地谈论着渔线漂浮的深度、稳定的好天气以及他们所见到的一切。那天成功的渔民已经回来，他们已经屠宰了自己的马林鱼，横放在两块木板上，每块木板的一端有两个人在挣扎，然后等待着卡车把它们运到哈瓦那市场。捕到鲨鱼的渔民已经把它们带到了海湾对面的鲨鱼工厂，那里用起重机把它们吊上，取出肝脏、割掉鳍、剥去皮毛，把肉切成条子腌制。
当风从东方吹来时，从鲨鱼工厂传来的恶臭味涌入了港口；但今天只有一丝幽香，因为风转向了北方，渐渐平静下来，露台上阳光明媚。
“圣地亚哥，”男孩说。
“是的，”老人说着。他正拿着杯子，回想起多年前的事情。
“明天我可以帮你去弄些沙丁鱼吗？”
“不用了。去打棒球吧。我还能划船，罗赫利奥会投网。”
“我想出去。如果不能跟你一起钓鱼，我想以某种方式帮助你。”
“你给我买了一杯啤酒，”老人说。“你已经是个男人了。”
“我第一次跟你乘船时有多大？”
“五岁，当时我把鱼拉上来太早，险些把船撕碎。你还记得吗？”
“我记得尾巴拍打的声音、板座断裂的声音以及捶打的声音。我记得你把我扔到湿漆的绕线堆里，感觉整个船都在颤抖，以及你用棒子捶打他的声音，就像砍倒一棵树，我还记得满身都是甜美的鲜血味。”
“你是真的记得还是我告诉你的？”

他是一个老人，在墨西哥湾的洋流中独自划着一只小船垂钓，已经有八十四天没有捕到一条鱼了。在最初的四十天里，有一个男孩陪着他。但是四十天没有捕到任何鱼之后，男孩的父母告诉他老人现在确实完全倒霉了，是最糟糕的倒霉形式，于是男孩按照他们的命令坐在另一只船上，第一周就捕到了三条好鱼。看到老人每天带着空空的小船回来，男孩感到难过，他总是去帮忙搬运盘绕着桅杆的捆线、鱼叉和帆，那打着卷的帆上补着面粉袋，像是永久失败的旗帜。

老人瘦弱得有深深的脖颈皱纹。太阳对热带海域的反射照来的仁慈性皮肤癌的褐色斑块在他的脸颊上。斑块一直延伸到他的脸两侧，他的手上有处理重鱼时留下的深深的伤痕。但是这些伤痕都不新鲜，已经像沙漠中的侵蚀一样古老。

除了他的眼睛，一切都显得古老，而他的眼睛与海水一样的颜色，愉快而不服输。

“圣地亚哥，”男孩和老人一起从小船拉到的河岸上爬上时说。“我可以再跟你去垂钓。我们赚了一些钱。”

老人教会了男孩钓鱼，男孩很喜欢他。

“不，”老人说。“你跟着那支幸运的船队吧。和他们一起。”

“但是你还记得那次八十七天没捕到鱼，接着我们连续三周每天都捕到大鱼的情景吗？”

The old man smiled and took a sip of his beer. The boy looked at him with admiration and said, “You are the best fisherman in the village, Santiago.”
The old man laughed and replied, “Maybe so, but the fish are smarter than me. That's why I haven't caught anything in eighty-four days.”
The boy's eyes widened in surprise. “Eighty-four days? That's a long time, Santiago.”
“Yes, but tomorrow will be different. I can feel it in the air,” the old man said confidently.
The boy smiled and patted Santiago on the back. “I believe in you, Santiago. You will catch a big fish tomorrow.”

was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

The old man smiled and patted the boy on the back. “You were a brave little boy then, and you are a brave young man now.”
The boy beamed with pride at the old man's words. He knew that despite his father's lack of faith, he had found a mentor and a father figure in the old fisherman.
As they finished their beers and gathered their things to head home, the old man looked out at the sea with a twinkle in his eye. He knew that tomorrow would bring new challenges, but with the boy by his side, he felt ready to face whatever came their way. The bond between them was strong, and together they would continue to conquer the sea.

这是一个在墨西哥湾深海中独自划着渔船的老人，他已经整整八十四天没有捕到鱼了。在最初的四十天里，有个男孩一直和他在一起。但是四十天过去了，没有捕到鱼，男孩的父母告诉他，这个老人现在被认定为salao，也就是最倒霉的形式，男孩依着他们的命令，换了一只船，结果第一周就捕到了三条大鱼。看到老人每天划着空荡荡的渔船回来，男孩感到悲伤，而他总是下去帮忙，帮老人扛着盘绕好的渔线、标枪和帆，这帆上打着补丁，像一个永远失败的旗帜。

老人瘦削，脖子后面有深深的皱纹。阳光在热带海洋的反射上会导致皮肤患上良性皮肤癌的褐斑出现在他的脸颊上。这些褐斑延伸到他脸的两侧，手上有深深的伤痕，是他在拉着重鱼绳时留下的。但是这些伤痕并不新鲜，就像是在一个贫瘠的无鱼沙漠上的腐蚀一样古老。

他身上的一切都显得古老，除了他的眼睛，它们和大海一样的颜色，充满了愉快和无畏。

“桑迪亚哥，”男孩在他们从拖上岸的渔船那个岗上爬上来时对他说，“我可以再和你一起去。我们赚了些钱。”

老人教导过男孩捕鱼，男孩也很爱他。

“不，”老人说，“你和一只幸运的船在一起，留下吧。”

“但你还记得吗，你曾经八十七天没有捕到鱼，然后我们连续三周每天都捕到大的。”

“五岁，当时你差点被我带回来的鱼咬得很惨，几乎把船给撕碎了。你还记得吗？”
“我记得鱼尾巴拍打和撞击，船横梁断裂，还有棍子打击的声音。我记得你把我扔到船头上，那里湿漉漉的绳线，感觉整个船都在发抖，我还记得你像砍树一样用棍子打击它，还记得那甜甜的鲜血味充斥着我周围。”

他是一位老人，在墨西哥湾的潜流中独自钓鱼，已经整整八十四天没有捕到鱼了。头四十天有一个男孩与他同行。但是四十天过去了，没有捕到鱼，男孩的父母告诉他，老人现在已经确实而彻底地是“萨劳”了，这是最不吉利的形式，于是男孩遵照他们的命令，坐在另一只小船上，第一个星期就捕到了三条大鱼。每天看到老人带着空船归来，男孩都觉得难过，他总是走下去帮忙，扛着盘绕的绳索，或者带着鱼叉和鱼钩的帆布，还有缠绕在桅杆周围的帆布。这块帆布上打着不少补丁，缠起来看起来就像一面永久失败的旗帜。

老人身形瘦削，颈后布满深深的皱纹。太阳照耀在热带海洋上，皮肤上的褐色斑块是良性皮肤癌的迹象，这些斑块延伸到他脸颊的两侧。他的双手上有玩赏沉甸甸的鱼绳留下的深深皱纹。但这些伤疤都不是新的，它们就像漫无边际的无鱼沙漠中的侵蚀一样古老。

他的一切都显得陈旧，只有他的眼睛是例外，它们与海洋一样的颜色，明亮而不屈。

“桑地亚哥，”男孩在他们从拖上来的小船下岸之时对他说。“我可以再跟你一起去。我们挣了些钱。”

老人教会了男孩如何捕鱼，男孩爱他。

“不，”老人说。“你已经跟着一个幸运的船了。留在他们身边。”

“但是你还记得吗？你曾经八十七天没有捕到鱼，然后我们连续三个星期每天都捕到大鱼。”

these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

“I remember everything from when we first went together.”
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s
and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”
“May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too.”
“I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box.”
“Let me get four fresh ones.”
“One,” the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they
were freshening as when the breeze rises.
“Two,” the boy said.
“Two,” the old man agreed. “You didn’t steal them?”
“I would,” the boy said. “But I bought these.”
“Thank you,” the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained
humility. But he [13] knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it
carried no loss of true pride.
“Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current,” he said.
“Where are you going?” the boy asked.
“Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light.”
“I’ll try to get him to work far out,” the boy said. “Then if you hook something truly
big we can come to your aid.”
“He does not like to work too far out.”
“No,” the boy said. “But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird
working and get
him to come out after dolphin.” “Are his eyes that bad?” “He is almost blind.” “It is
strange,” the old man said. “He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes.” “But
you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good.”
“I am a strange old man”
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?”
“I think so. And there are many tricks.”
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. “So I can get the cast net and go after
the sardines.”
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked.
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?”
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?”
“No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.”
“May I take the cast net?”
“Of course.”
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. “Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man said. “How would you like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” “I’ll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?”
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s paper and I will read the baseball.” The boy did not
know whether yesterday’s paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explained. “I’ll be back when I have the
sardines. I’ll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back you can tell me about the baseball.”
“The Yankees cannot lose.”
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.”

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

以及马克斯·佩金斯
这是一个独自在墨西哥湾艇中捕鱼的老人，他已经连续八十四天没有捕到鱼了。在头四十天里，有一个男孩和他在一起。但是在四十天没捕到鱼之后，男孩的父母告诉他，老人现在肯定是彻底倒霉了，这是最糟糕的不幸形式，于是男孩按照他们的命令，坐着另一只船，第一周就捕到了三条好鱼。看着老人每天拉着空船回来，男孩感到难过，他总是下去帮忙，帮他搬运盘绳，鱼叉，船帆，这些帆用面粉袋修补过，卷着，看起来像是永久失败的旗帜。
老人瘦弱，脖子后面有深深的皱纹。太阳反射在热带海洋上，带来的仁慈皮肤癌的棕色斑块在他的脸颊上。斑块延伸到他脸的两边，他的手上有处理重鱼绳时留下的深深的疤痕。但是这些疤痕都不新鲜，它们和一个无鱼的沙漠中的侵蚀一样古老。
他的一切都很陈旧，除了他的眼睛，它们和大海一样的颜色，快乐而不被打败。
“桑地亚哥，”男孩对他说，当他们从拉上来的船索攀登上岸时。“我可以再和你一起去。我们挣了一些钱。”
老人教会了男孩捕鱼，男孩爱他。
“不，”老人说。“你和一个幸运的船在一起。留在他们身边。”
“但你还记得你八十七天没捕到鱼，然后我们连续三周每天都捕到大鱼的情况吧。”

"是爸爸让我离开的。我是个孩子，必须听他的话。"
"我知道，"老人说道。"那很正常。"
"他没有太多信心。"
"不，"老人说道。"但是我们有。对吧？"
"是的，"男孩说道。"我在露台上请你喝一杯啤酒，然后我们把东西带回家吧。"
"为什么不呢？"老人说道。"咱们都是渔夫。"
他们坐在露台上，许多渔夫取笑老人，但他并不生气。其他年长的渔夫看着他，感到难过。但他们没有表现出来，他们礼貌地谈论着当天的潮汐和他们下钓的深度，还有持续的好天气，以及他们看到的东西。那天取得成功的渔夫已经归来，把自己的马林鱼屠宰，并把它们横放在两块木板上，两个人拖着每块木板的末端摇摇晃晃地前往鱼屋，等待冰车把它们送到哈瓦那市场。那些捕捉到鲨鱼的人则把它们带到海湾对面的鲨鱼工厂，用起重机吊起它们，取出它们的肝脏，割下它们的鳍，去皮，将它们的肉切成条进行腌制。
当东风吹来时，从鲨鱼工厂远处港口传来一阵气味；但今天只有一点淡淡的气味，因为风向转向了北方，然后消失了，露台上阳光明媚，气候宜人。
"圣地亚哥，"男孩说道。
"是的，"老人说道。他抱着杯子，回忆着许多年前的往事。
"我明天可以出去给你弄些沙丁鱼吗？"
"不用了。去打棒球吧。我还可以划船，罗赫里奥会扔渔网。"
"我想去。如果不能和你一起钓鱼，我想以某种方式为你服务。"
"你给我买了一杯啤酒，"老人说道。"你已经是个男人了。"
"我第一次和你一起出海是几岁时？"
"五岁，当时我把鱼拉上来时，你几乎被磨成碎片。你还记得吗？"
"我记得鱼尾巴拍打的声音，桨板被打碎的声音，还有那个拍击的声音。我记得你把我扔到湿漉漉的船头，感受到整条船都在震动，还有你拍击的声音像砍树一样，浓厚血腥的气味弥漫着我。"
"你真的记得吗，还是我只是告诉过你而已？"

老人用他那被太阳晒得发红的，自信和充满爱意的眼睛看着他。
“如果你是我的孩子，我会带你出去赌博的，”他说。“但你是你父亲和母亲的孩子，而且你在一只幸运的船上。”
“我能去弄点沙丁鱼吗？我知道我还能找到四条诱饵。”
“我今天剩下的还够用。我把它们放在盒子里泡盐水了。”
“让我去买四条新鲜的。”
“一条，”老人说。他的希望和自信从未消失。但现在它们又像微风一样恢复。
“二条，”男孩说。
“二条，”老人同意了。“你没有偷吗？”
“我可能会，”男孩说。“但这些是我买的。”
“谢谢，”老人说。他太朴实，不会琢磨自己何时获得了谦卑。但他知道自己已经获得了，并且知道这并不可耻，并且没有丧失真正的骄傲。
“明天风和日丽，会是个好天气，”他说。
“你去哪里？”男孩问。
“远远出海，等风向转变再回来。我想要在天还没亮之前就出发。”
“我会努力让他远远出海工作，”男孩说。“这样如果你钓到了真正大的鱼，我们就能帮忙。”
“他不喜欢在太远出海工作。”
“对，”男孩说。“但我会看到一些他看不到的东西，比如一只在捕鱼的鸟，然后引诱他去追逐海豚。”
“他的眼睛很差吗？”
“他几乎是瞎子了。”
“真奇怪，”老人说。“他从来不捕海龟。那才会伤眼睛。”
“但你在蚊子海岸捕海龟了那么多年，你的眼睛还好。”
“我是一个奇怪的老人。”
“但你现在有足够的力气钓到真正大的鱼吗？”
“我想是的。而且有许多窍门。”
“我们把东西带回家，”男孩说。“这样我就能取一张网，去捉沙丁鱼。”
他们从船上拿起装备。老人把桅杆背在肩上。

老人和男孩提着木船，船上缠着坚硬的棕色绳子，还有鱼叉和带有支柄的鱼叉。鱼饵盒放在船尾的小船中，还有一根用来制服大鱼的棒子。没有人会偷老人的东西，但最好把帆和沉重的绳子带回家，因为露水对它们有害，尽管老人确信当地人不会偷他的东西，但他认为在船上留下鱼叉和鱼叉是不必要的诱惑。

他们一起沿着路走到老人的小屋，走进开着的门。老人把带着卷好的帆的桅杆靠在墙上，男孩把盒子和其他装备放在旁边。桅杆几乎和小屋的一个房间一样长。小屋是用皇家棕榈的坚硬芽鳞壳制成的，被称为瓜诺，在里面有一张床、一张桌子、一把椅子，和一个在土地上用木炭烹饪的地方。在坚韧纤维瓜诺的褶皱叠合的棕色墙壁上，有一幅彩色的耶稣圣心像和另一幅科布雷圣母像。这些是他妻子的遗物。墙上曾经有一张着色的妻子的照片，但他把它拿下来，因为看到它让他感到太孤独，现在照片放在角落的架子上，他干净的衬衫下面。

“你想吃点什么？”男孩问。

“一锅黄色米饭配鱼。你想吃吗？”

“不，我回家吃。你要我生火吗？”

“不，我过会儿再做。或者我可能吃冷米饭。”

“我可以拿着抛网吗？”

“当然可以。”

但是并没有抛网，男孩记得他们什么时候把抛网卖掉的。但他们每天都过这个虚拟的场景。也没有一锅黄色的米饭和鱼，男孩也知道这点。“85是一个幸运数字，”老人说。“你想看我抓一条重量超过一千磅的鱼吗？”“我去拿抛网捕沙丁鱼。你坐在门口晒太阳吗？”

“好的。我有昨天的报纸，我会看棒球。”男孩不知道昨天的报纸是否也是虚构的。但是老人从床下拿出来了。

“佩里科在酒商给我了，”他解释道。“我捕到沙丁鱼后就回来。我会把你的和我的一起放在冰上，明天早上我们可以分享。等我回来你可以告诉我棒球的情况。”

“洋基队不会输。”

“但我担心克利夫兰的印第安人。”
